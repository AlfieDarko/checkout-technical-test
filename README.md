## Thoughts

## If I Had More Time

-> Chart - Recharts

-> More Testing - 1st time using react-testing-library - usually use jest / enzyme but I like to challenge mysef in tech tests by considering alternate technology

-> Use Star Selection as rating input - would have been more visually appealing - Ran out of time - Could have stole the one from uber's Base.web design system

-> Styled Components - Took a pragmatic approach. Since it was a small project, I only used what I needed.
A few times when dealing iwth styling logic I thought things may have been cleaner with styled components, esp when taking a reusable approach to component design.

-> postcss vs sass - Only really needed css nesting sytnax so opted for postcss as it comes bare bones and you only include what you need. Not really any advanced CSS going on that I would need mixins etc. CSS variables are widely supported now too so using postcss meant I just brought in packages & features that are actually needed. Hammer for a nail not gun for a nail.

--> DB > Firebase instead of sheety.co - I enjoy sheety.co for quick prototyping but setting up cloud functions would have been abit more fitting & shown proficiency in setting up APIs & working with the cloud etc.
If I had more time I would have went down that route.

-> Perf enhancements. Lazy Loading only load the comments when in screen. Perhaps a load comments button instead of instantly displaying them.

-> If I was to develop this further, I would think about the user experience of having a 100 reviews. I'd perhaps implement pagination on the FE or maybe an infinite scroll type view with the reviews. This saves the user bandwith as we wont have to load up 100+ comments at once.

-> CSS Animations & Interactions

- Definitely felt I could have done more on this front to add a more pleasant user experience and demonstrate css animation & interaction knowledge

-> Utility Classes, CSS Variable, CSS @Imports,

- React Context for state management.
- Didn't need react / redux in this case as it was a small project. I think its important to select the right tools for the job and handling state with reacts context, reducer etc. was enough.
- In production apps redux may have been the best choice but its always wise to evaluate the tools you use for what job.
- A project bigger than this, I would have reached for redux
